# IntelÂ® Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree Program by [Udacity and Intel](https://www.udacity.com/course/intel-edge-ai-for-iot-developers-nanodegree--nd131)

# Queue System

This project is about testing and choosing the right hardware for specific scenarios with the help of [Intel Dev Cloud](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/devcloud.html). 

* CPU
* GPU
* FPGA
* VPU e.g. NCS-2

As example there are 3 queue systems

1. [Manufactoring](Manufacturing_Scenario.ipynb )
2. [Retail](Retail_Scenario.ipynb )
3. [Transportation](Transportation_Scenario.ipynb )

The result with the arguments for each choice is present in [here](choose-the-right-hardware-proposal-template.pdf)
